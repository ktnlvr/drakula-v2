## Philosophy & Rules

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Assert your assumptions.
* The code should look like one person wrote it.
* Handle errors like any other return value.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Rebase is better than merge.
* Code should be read by more people at a time.
* Test everything testable.
* Don't make system-dependent code.
* Seed your randomness.
* Format your code.

Based on Zen of Python and previous experience.
